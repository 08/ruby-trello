# Ruby Trello API

This library implements the [Trello](http://www.trello.com/) [API](http://trello.com/api).

Trello is an awesome tool for organization. Not just aimed at developers, but everybody.
Seriously, [check it out](http://www.trello.com/).

## Installation

Full disclosure: It doesn't presently work. I'm in the process of implementing
the specs and the functionality. But if you want to check it out, clone the
repo for now. I will produce a gem when it's at least minimally usable. When
that is the case, I'll post that information here.

## Contributing

Pick up an editor, fix a test! (If you want to, of course.) Send a pull
request, and I'll look at it. I only ask a few things:

1. Feature branches please!
2. Adding or refactoring existing features, ensure there are tests.

Also, don't be afraid to send a pull request if your changes aren't done. Just
let me know.
