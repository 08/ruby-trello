# Ruby Trello API

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello)

This library implements the [Trello](http://www.trello.com/) [API](http://trello.com/api).

Trello is an awesome tool for organization. Not just aimed at developers, but everybody.
Seriously, [check it out](http://www.trello.com/).

## Installation

```
# gem install ruby-trello
```

Full Disclosure: This library is not complete, but it does function enough to be useful.

## Special thanks

A special thanks goes out to [Ben Biddington](https://github.com/ben-biddington) who has contributed a significant amount
of refactoring and functionality to be deserving of a beer and this special thanks.

## Contributing

Pick up an editor, fix a test! (If you want to, of course.) Send a pull
request, and I'll look at it. I only ask a few things:

1. Feature branches please!
2. Adding or refactoring existing features, ensure there are tests.

Also, don't be afraid to send a pull request if your changes aren't done. Just
let me know.
